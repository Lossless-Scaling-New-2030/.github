## What is Lossless Scaling?

**Lossless Scaling** is a powerful tool that enhances your gaming experience by making games smoother with **LSFG frame generation** and optionally improving quality or performance with various scaling algorithms and machine learning models like **LS1**.  

It's compatible with most games — even those that don't have built-in frame generation or scaling — as well as with other applications and a wide range of hardware.

### LSFG 3 Frame Generation

This feature creates additional frames to make games look smoother.  
It’s perfect for games that lack a built-in solution or require new hardware, as well as for older games and emulators with a locked frame rate.

**LSFG** is a proprietary machine learning model developed from scratch specifically for Lossless Scaling and has received several significant updates.

- Compatible with a wide range of hardware  
- Includes a separate performance model for low-power GPUs  
- **Fixed mode** allows multiplying the original frame rate  
- **Adaptive mode** lets you specify a desired frame rate that may not be a multiple of the original

---

## Scaling

Scaling allows you to improve performance by lowering the original resolution and applying upscaling to recover some of the quality.  
It's also great for older games and pixel art games that don’t support modern resolutions or fullscreen mode.

**Recommended scaling algorithms:**

- **LS1, FSR, NIS** → Best for modern games  
- **Integer, XBR** → Ideal for pixel art games  
- **Anime4K** → Great for cartoons or anime

## Dual GPU Support

A great feature of Lossless Scaling is the ability to offload computations to a second GPU.  
This means applying frame generation or scaling won't affect the game's original frame rate and may reduce latency.

---

## Compatibility with Online Games

The community has found Lossless Scaling to be **safe to use with online games** that have built-in anti-cheat systems.  
However, this cannot be guaranteed and should be used with **user discretion**.

---

## Customization

Lossless Scaling provides extensive configuration options through **Game Profiles**, allowing you to save per-game or grouped settings.  

Profiles eliminate the need for repetitive manual adjustments by automatically applying your chosen settings and scaling whenever the game executable is detected — ensuring consistent and automated operation.

---

## Requirements

- Only **windowed** and **borderless fullscreen** modes are supported.  
  - Exclusive fullscreen may work only if the Lossless Scaling output is configured for a second display.
- **Free GPU resources** are preferred — otherwise, Lossless Scaling may affect the game’s original frame rate.
- **Windows 10, version 2004 or newer**

---

## Linux Support

The **LSFG** feature of Lossless Scaling is available on Linux as a community-driven port.  
For more details, check out the **[lsfg-vk]()** project.
